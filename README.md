# Leap Seconds

[Leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are seconds that could be added (or removed) at set periods during the year, at the end of one of four months.
This is done to synchronize our standardized clock times for a full Earth year (called [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)) with the actual physical time it takes the Earth to circle around the sun.
It usually takes a bit longer (a fraction of a second) than the exact seconds on our standardized clocks, so every number of years a leap second is added to the official clock time.
This does not show up in our computer clock times, because they either smear out the extra leap second over the standardized time (on Windows),
or make the leap second last twice as long without updating the display time (on Linux).
