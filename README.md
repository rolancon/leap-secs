# Leap Seconds

[Leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are seconds that could be added (or removed) at set periods (usually every 1.5 years) at the end of one of four predetermined months (usually June or December). This is done to synchronize our standardized clock times for a full Earth year, called [Universal Coordination Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC), with the actual physical time it takes the Earth to circle around the sun (already taking into account the extra leap day on February 29 every four years). It usually takes a bit longer (a fraction of a second) than the exact number of UTC seconds (31,556,926 seconds in a non leap year), so every number of years a leap second is added to UTC.

On the Windows 10 operating system this extra leap second shows as second displayed as `60` (where normal seconds are from `00` to `59`). On UNIX-derived operating systems, like Linux, this does not show up on their computer clock times, because they make the leap second last twice as long without updating the display time (so both seconds display as `59`). That is because its time reckoning is based on UNIX time, which always totals to 86,400 seconds for a day, even for [UNIX time leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#Leap_seconds).  

To generalize actual time between Windows 10 and Linux this repository contains a CSV (comma-separated valus) file based on the official data available from the [International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service](https://www.iers.org
) (IERS). It shows for every two end-of month periods (June 30 and December 31) for each year since 1970 (the start of UNIX time) whether a leap second has been added (`1`) or not (`0`).

The format makes it easy to parse and process programmatically: just interpret the combination of Year (per row) and Month-Day (per column) as an [ISO 8601 date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). For instance, the row for year `2016` has a date `2016-06-30` with no extra leap second (`0`) and a date `2016-12-31` with an extra leap second (`1`). That means that on the date `2016-12-31`  Windows 10 has a datetime for both `2016-12-31 23:59:59` (the second before the leap second) and `2016-12-31 23:59:60` (the leap second), and Linux only has a datetime for `2016-12-31 23:59:59` (combining both the second before the leap second and the leap second itself).
